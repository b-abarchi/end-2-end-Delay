# End-2-end-Delay
Write a program that produces the comparison of size of each packet vs. the end-to-end delay of the transmission of the entire message of 16 kb
A source (node A), a destination (node B), and two intermediate store-and-forward switches. Each packet sent from the source must be transmitted over three links before it reaches the destination. Each of these links has a transmission rate of 4 kbps. Ignore the propagation delays and all other delays.

As we go on in our experiment, the size of each packet from node A varies from 4kb to 2kb, to 1kb, â€¦ to 125bits.
